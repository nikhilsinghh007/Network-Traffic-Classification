# Network-Traffic-Classification
This project involves building an SVM-based binary classifier to identify normal or malicious network traffic using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. The model was trained, tested, and achieved high accuracy (96.6%), precision (96.8%), recall (98.2%), and F1-score (97.5%), effectively distinguishing between the two classes.
