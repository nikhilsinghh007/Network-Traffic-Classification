# Network-Traffic-Classification
This project focuses on building a binary classification model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model is trained to classify data based on a given feature set from the UNSW-NB15 dataset. After preprocessing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets, the SVM model was trained and evaluated, achieving high performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Points:
Objective: Classify network traffic data (normal or malicious) using SVM.
Dataset: UNSW-NB15.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy (96.6%), Precision (96.8%), Recall (98.2%), F1-score (97.5%).
